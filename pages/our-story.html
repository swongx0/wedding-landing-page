        <p class="remove-margin">The start of our story was back when we were working at Uniqlo in 2016. I was a transfer from another location and Nancy had stopped working for a while. The day she returned to work again, I became more mindful of when she started her shift. I had never met someone named Nancy before and heard a lot about her in passing from coworkers. The moment she checked in for work, I had to head to the shop floor to meet this beautiful lady with a smile. I didn't realize that smile of mine also captivated her heart.</p>
        <blockquote>This was the start of a love that was meant to be.</blockquote>
        <p class="remove-margin">After going through a rough patch and trying to find myself again, I decided to return to Uniqlo as a part-time employee. That is when I met Moses on January 2016. My colleagues were excited for my return and talked about me a lot which peaked Moses's interest so he became curious. On my first day back, I happened to be working the same shift as Moses. He went out of his way to greet me at the front of the store with a big, charming smile. His smile meant everything. It brightened the room and I was mesmerized when he shook my hands. Little did I know, Moses also had a crush on me but he hid it so well! Having avoided our feelings for one another for a year, we fell into place when Moses decided to leave Uniqlo.</p>

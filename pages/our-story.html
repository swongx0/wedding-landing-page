        <p class="remove-margin">The start of our story was back when we both were working at Uniqlo in 2016. Moses was a transfer from another location and Nancy had stopped working for a while. The day Nancy came back to working again Moses kept tabs on when she started her shift cause he never met a Nancy before and heard a lot about her in passing from coaaaaaworkers. Then the moment Nancy checked in for work Moses had to head to the shop floor to meet this beautiful lady with a smile. He didn't realize that smile of his also captivated her heart.</p>
        <blockquote>This was the start of a love that was meant to be.</blockquote>
        <p class="remove-margin">Asking Nancy out: Grizzly Peak. Played 'Best Part' on guitar for her and sang. Nancy confesses that she does like Moses then goes out for a hike. Moses goes with her. Nancy asks, " so are you going to ask me out or not?" Moses said, "OH! uhmm, will you go out with me?"</p>
        <p class="remove-margin">Proposal: Mastros Steakhouse. Had dinner, hostess was given a note and walked Nancy and Moses to their table in a quiet corner. Moses was waiting for receipt to arrive and went to the restroom to practice his lines. Comes back and continues waiting for receipt. Gets off chair and fell. Nancy freaks out and asks if he was okay. Moses mumbles, "Will you marry me?" and tries to put ring on Nancy's finger. Nancy can't stop laughing.</p>
